DIARY1,"Dear Diary,\nI'm really doing it. My cousin got me three racing chickens.\n\nI put down some turf and straw on the balcony of my apartment and put up a flag so you can't see them from the street. I found a great website, ChickenWeb, about raising and racing them.\n\nI drove out to the farm store for food and they gave me a sample pack of 5 days of their specialty grasses.\n\nThe fastest chicken I got is Mignon. My cousin said she's the offspring of a chicken from the famous Vanchokens racing farm that didn't meet expectations so she was cheap.\n\nThere's a race every day, I guess I'll see how she does!\n\n<3"
HYBRID,"Wow, I bred %s and %s together and they made a new type of chicken!! %s is a beautiful %s. Is she faster thanher mother too? I should see what other breeds I can discover."
BRONZE,"I defeated the members of of the Bronze League.\n\n\n%s, %s, and %s all performed amazingly! The crowd went wild for them, I bet they'll show up to meet them later at the petting zoo.\n\nIt was a great chance to get to know the other farms. It turns out St. Germain's is run by monks! That explains the robes, and why they keep racing even though they never win. Their chickens race for free but if they win the money goes to the monestary (makes a great training ground for my newer chickens too hehe). I wonder if I can see the place sometime...\n\nI think it's time to get a small farm with more room for the chickens, maybe they can help me look for something at the shop."
BEAT_VANCHOKENS,"%s won a race against the almighty Vanchockens! Take that! The first of many for sure. The crowd was chanting %s's name - if she wasn't famous already she is now, I hope someone from her new fanclub shows up on petting zoo days."
NO_MORE_BRONZE,"Well I saw that coming... they voted me out of Bronze League. I'm going to miss seeing the people from St. Germain's and Anualonacu (I won't say more about the other ones). Those intense races really brought us together. It was getting to be too easy money anyways!"
SILVER,"Things are really heating up, I won the Silver League! Well, %s, %s, and %s won, fans went wild for them!\nEvery time I race in Silver League I get some free jam samples from one of the competators, Jam Jar Farms. They run a seeeerious business over there, I can't believe finally I took them down.\nI went to see the chickens on the Bec-de-Beak farm, it's right on the river and guess what - the chickens swim! I wonder if thats how they get so strong."
GOLD,"Shit! You won. Thanks for playing <3\n%s, %s, and %s really killed it."
