DIARY1,"Dear Diary,\nI'm really doing it. My cousin got me three racing chickens.\n\nI put down some turf and straw on the balcony of my apartment and put up a flag so you can't see them from the street. I found a great website, ChickenWeb, about raising and racing them.\n\nI drove out to the farm store for food and they gave me a sample pack of 5 days of their specialty grasses.\n\nThe fastest chicken I got is Mignon. My cousin said she's the offspring of a chicken from the famous Vanchokens racing farm that didn't meet expectations so she was cheap.\n\nThere's a race every day, I guess I'll see how she does!\n\n<3"
HYBRID,"Wow, I bred %s and %s together and they made a new type of chicken!! %s is a beautiful %s. I should see what other breeds I can discover"
BRONZE,"I defeated the members of of the Bronze League. I think it's time to get a small farm with more room for the chickens.\n%s, %s, and %s all performed amazingly!
