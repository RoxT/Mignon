EVERY DAY RACES
In order to be part of the racing circut, you must compete  in one the races held every day. Every farm in the circuit competes but because there are multiple races held on the same day your racer will only face 3 other farms per race. This is a great way to show off your flock and maybe earn some money.

LEAGUE RACES
These are special event you can enter. They are multiple days long and to win you must  win every race. "
